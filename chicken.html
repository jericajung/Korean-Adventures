                    <p class= "paragraph">Korean fried chicken or seasoned chicken is a fried chicken dish prepared in a Korean style. It is consumed as a meal, fast food at bars, or as an after meal snack in Korea. Korean fried chicken differs from typical American fried chicken by being fried twice. This results in the skin being crunchier and less greasy. Furthermore, Korean-style chicken is not characterized by the crags and crusty nubs associated with American fried chicken as described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times as a "thin, crackly and almost transparent". The chickens are usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chicken, in other words, younger chickens resulting in more tender meat. Afterwards, the chicken is usually hand painted with a brush, to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer of sauce. Pickled radishes, beer, and soju are often served with Korean fried chicken.</p>

                    <p class= "paragraph">From the roasted chicken that appeared in early 1960s to the spicy chicken that was adapted to meet Korean tastes, Korea has imported and developed a growing variety of chicken dishes. At the same time chicken was becoming more popular, a draft beer that appeared in the 1970s also became very popular, and eventually it became common for the two to be combined as a single menu item. Moreover, the 2002 Koreaâ€“Japan World Cup triggered the sensation of Chimaek. Chimaek has had a significant impact on Korean drinking culture. This is well known as Chimaek, which is the tradition and culture where in Korea they eat chicken with beer.</p>

					<p class= "paragraph">Chimaek is a compound word formed from chicken and maekju, the Korean word for "beer". It refers to a combination of chicken (usually fried or spicy) as Anju and beer served around evening in many South Korean restaurants, including a number of specialized chains. It is a great way to socialize with friends and family. Chimaek has become very popular and is often used in popular culture. Many restaurants make significant profit from their restaurants. Chimaek is a profitable franchise. Demand for specialty chicken shops increased with the growing demands for chicken and beer. As of March 2014 Korea had 192 chicken franchise companies. About 10% of companies are known for unique recipes</p>

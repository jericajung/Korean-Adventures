# Korean Adventures

This project is a travel guide to the South Korea city of Seoul. It includes basic facts and history and the
landmarks to visit when traveling to Seoul. The site/guide describes the beauty and depicts the city as
interesting and fun to visit. The site is mainly targeted for those who have never visited the city; I hope
it would make people interested to go to Seoul one day.

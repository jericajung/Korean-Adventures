                <h1>SUN-DAE (BLOOD SAUSAGES)</h1>
                <p>Sun-dae is known as blood sausages, and they are also a very popular street food dish. The <br> dish uses coagulated pigs blood, glass noodles and barley, with pig or cow intestines for the sausage skin. Also, if you’re ordering on the street, each order usually comes with a few <br> slices of liver or lung on the side. Some of you are grossed out by this. Don’t worry, some <br> Koreans are too.</p>

                <h1>ODDENG (FISH CAKE)</h1>
                <p>At about 500 won (around 50 cents) a stick, fish cakes are the cheapest street foods you’ll <br> find. Eating them will make you warm right away. They’re skewered on a stick and left in a delicious broth, which happens to be free with any order (not just odeng) and can cures bad <br> hang overs. You'll end up eating two or three or even more if you're very hungry. Put on <br> some soy sauce to enjoy.</p>

                <h1>FRIED SNACKS</h1>
                <p>In Korean, fried snacks are known as TWIGIM. The same carts that sell you ddeokbokki, <br> blood sausages and odeng also have delicious fried goods. These fried foods are dipped in a <br> batter to allow for a flakey shell. Ingredients range from dumplings, eggs, peppers, sweet <br> potatoes, and more.</p>

                <h1>GIMBAP (KOREAN SUSHI)</h1>
                <p>It looks like sushi, but this is its Korean cousin, gimbap – dressier with a seaweed (gim) wrap <br> and glazed in flavour you can almost see and the rice (bap) and seaweed are lightly infused with perilla oil. Fillings are much like sushi with a lot of variety such as meats, vegetables, <br> and eggs. These rolls are ubiquitous at street stalls and markets, and fresh versions can even be found all over the country.</p>

                <h1>MANDU (DUMPLINGS)</h1>
                <p>Korean dumplings (mandu) come deliciously fried or boiled in a noodle soup. As a street snack the most likely choice is kimchi mandu, which are filled with sweet onion, minced pork and a load of spicy kimchi that you can see shimmering orange through the soft skin. Kogi mandu <br> are stuffed with a gingery minced pork and spring onions. These pockets of flavour are warm <br> and delicious, but sometimes spicy enough to warrant a warning from the chef.</p>

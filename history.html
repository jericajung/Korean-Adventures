                    <p class= "paragraph">Seoul is the capital and largest city in South Korea. It is considered a megacity because it has a population of over ten million people and it is one of the largest cities in the entire world. Nearly half of the South Korea's entire population lives in the Seoul National Capital Area (which also includes Incheon and Gyeonggi and makes it the second largest metropolitan area in the world). Because of its very large population, Seoul is considered a global city and it is the center of South Korea's economy, culture and politics.</p>

					<p class= "paragraph"><h2>Here are some interesting facts about the beautiful city of Seoul:</h2></p>

					<p class= "paragraph">1) Throughout its history, Seoul was known by a number of different names. The name Seoul itself is believed to have originated from the Korean word for capital city, Seoraneol. The name Seoul is interesting however because it has no matching Chinese characters, instead a Chinese name for the city, which sounds similar has recently been chosen.</p>

                   <img id="topic-image" src="flag.jpg">

					<p class= "paragraph">2) Seoul has been continuously settled for over 2,000 years and it is believed that the city was first founded in 18 B.C.E by the Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The city also remained as the capital of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty and the Korean Empire. During Japanese colonization of Korea in the early 20th century, Seoul became known as Gyeongseong.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">3) In 1945, Korea gained its independence from Japan and the city was renamed Seoul. In 1949, the city separated from Gyeonggi Province and it became a "special city." In 1950 however, North Korean troops occupied the city during the Korean War and the entire city was nearly destroyed. On March 14, 1951, United Nations forces took control of Seoul and since then, the city has rebuilt and grown considerably.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">4) Seoul is located in the northwestern part of South Korea. The city of Seoul itself has an area of 233.7 square miles (605.2 sq km) and it is cut in half by the Han River which was previously used as a trade route to China and helped the city grow throughout its history. The Han River is no longer used for navigation however because its estuary is at the border between North and South Korea. Seoul is surrounded by several mountains but the city itself is relatively flat because it is on the Han River plain. The average elevation of Seoul is 282 feet (86 m).</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">5). As one of the largest cities in the world and a leading global city, Seoul has become the headquarters for many international companies. Currently it is the headquarters of companies like Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kia. It also generates over 20% of South Korea's gross domestic product. In addition to its large multinational companies, Seoul's economy is focused on tourism, building and manufacturing. The city is also known for its shopping and the Dongdaemun Market, which is the largest market in South Korea, is located in the city.</p>
